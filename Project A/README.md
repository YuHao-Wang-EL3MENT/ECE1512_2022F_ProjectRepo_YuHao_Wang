This is the first project of ECE1512


The first task is using MNIST dataset to train a convolution teacher model and a fully connect student model and perform knowledge distillation method.


The second task is using MHIST dataset and transfer learning to perform knowledge distillation with ResNet teacher model and MobileNet student.


Hyperparameter tunning and fine tunning of the model is performed in both task.
